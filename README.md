The CS210 project is designed with a clear goal: to make fiscal responsibility engaging and understandable for high school students. It achieves this through a practical, interactive application that vividly demonstrates the growth of investments over time, making the concept of saving and investing more relatable and less daunting for students.

In my work on this project, I excelled in implementing input validation, ensuring the program processes only valid data. I also effectively structured the program to separate different functionalities, making it easy to understand and maintain. To enhance the code, I could implement more efficient compound interest calculation algorithms, improving performance for substantial inputs.

The most challenging part of the code was the interest calculation, particularly managing the precision of floating-point calculations. I overcame this by using the <iomanip> library to format output, ensuring accurate and readable results. The skills I developed in input validation and error handling will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework. I used a modular design and clear naming conventions to make the program maintainable, legible, and adaptable, structuring the program into separate functions and classes with meaningful variable and function names.
